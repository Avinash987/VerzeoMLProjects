# Data Analysis and Regression in Python

This Python script includes data analysis and regression tasks, structured into two parts: Part A and Part B.

## Part A
### Data Loading
- The script starts by loading the `mtcars` dataset from a CSV file and converting it into an Excel file.

### Multiple Linear Regression
- It then performs multiple linear regression using the `sklearn` library on the `bankloan` dataset, including data splitting, regression equation estimation, and prediction.

### Confusion Matrix
- The script calculates a confusion matrix for the regression results.

## Part B
### Data Analysis and Visualization
- In this part, the script explores the `mtcars` dataset and performs various data analysis and visualization tasks.

### Data Summary
- It displays the head, tail, summary statistics, shape, data types, and column names of the `mtcars` dataset.

### Data Visualization
- Histograms and box plots for the "mpg" variable are created using `matplotlib`.

### Value Counts and Cross-Tabulation
- The script computes value counts for the "Number of Vehicles," "mpg," "hp," and "drat" variables.
- Cross-tabulations are performed for "drat" and "hp" as well as "cyl" and "vs."

### Multiple Linear Regression
- The script conducts multiple linear regression on a modified `mtcars` dataset, with data splitting, regression equation estimation, and prediction.

### Confusion Matrix
- A confusion matrix is calculated for the regression results.

## Dependencies
- The script utilizes various Python libraries, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `xlrd`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib`. Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment.

## Usage
- The script can be executed in a Python environment. It demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and regression techniques and can serve as a reference for similar tasks.
